# SER502-Sparkup-Team12

## Overview
**Sparkup** is a custom-designed programming language created to support fundamental data types (Booleans, integers, floats, and strings), conditional logic, looping constructs, and variable assignments. The goal of **Sparkup** is to provide an easy-to-use language that can demonstrate core concepts of programming language design and execution, including lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime evaluation.

## System Requirements
To build and run the Sparkup language, the following tools and platforms are required:

### Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Mac

### Tools
- **DCG (Definite Clause Grammar)**: For defining the grammar and parsing the Sparkup language.
- **ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)**: For generating parsers and performing syntax analysis for the Sparkup language.
