# SER502-Sparkup-Team12

## Overview
**Sparkup** is a lightweight, custom-designed programming language created to support fundamental data types (Booleans, integers, floats, and strings), conditional logic, looping constructs, and variable assignments. It provides a straightforward platform for understanding key principles of programming language design and execution.

The main features of **Sparkup** include:

- **Primitive Data Types**: Booleans, integers, floats, and strings.
- **Boolean Operators**: AND, OR, NOT.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Relational Operators**: Greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), equals (`==`), and not equals (`!=`).
- **Conditional Constructs**: Ternary operator (`condition ? value_true : value_false`) and traditional `if-else` statements.
- **Looping Constructs**: Traditional `for` and `while` loops.
- **Print Statements**: Support for outputting all supported data types.

**Sparkup** is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to explore the core aspects of programming language development, including lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime execution.

## System Requirements
To build and run the Sparkup language, the following tools and platforms are required:

### Supported Platforms
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

### Tools
- **Flex**: For lexical analysis.
- **Bison**: For parsing.
- **GCC** (or any C/C++ compiler): For compiling the Sparkup runtime.
- **Make**: For automating the build process.
