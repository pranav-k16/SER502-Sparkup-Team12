## Overview
**Sparkup** is a custom-designed programming language created to support fundamental data types (Booleans, integers, floats, and strings), conditional logic, looping constructs, and variable assignments. The goal of Sparkup is to provide an easy-to-use language that can demonstrate core concepts of programming language design and execution, including lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime evaluation.


## System Requirements
To build and run the Sparkup language, the following tools and platforms are required:

### Supported Platforms
- Windows
- Mac

### Tools
- **DCG (Definite Clause Grammar)**: For defining the grammar and parsing the Sparkup language.
- **PLY(Python Lex Yacc)**: For building the lexer and parser, implementing tokenization, syntax analysis, and grammar validation for Sparkup language.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run Sparkup, you need Python and ply 3.11

### Installation on Linux & Mac
1. Open a terminal.
   
2. Install the required `ply` library:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install ply==3.11
   
3. Navigate to your Sparkup Project Directory:Replace <Path to your project> with the actual path to your project directory
   ```bash
   cd ~/<Path to your project>/SER502-Sparkup-Team12

   Example:cd ~/Desktop/SER502-Sparkup-Team12
   
4. Set Up an Alias: Create a temporary alias for running .skp files using the runner script. Replace <Path to your project> with the path to your project directory
   ```bash
   alias skp="python ~/<Path to your project>/SER502-Sparkup-Team12/src/runner.py"

   Example: alias skp="python ~/Desktop/SER502-Sparkup-Team12/src/runner.py"
   
5. Now, you can run the code with:
   ```bash
   skp data/<filename.skp>

   Example: skp data/test2.skp
   ```

### Installation on Windows
1. **Open Command Prompt**.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\your\project
   ```
3. Install the PLY library:
   ```cmd
   python -m pip install ply==3.11
   ```
4. To execute the Sparkup code, use the following command:
   ```cmd
   python src/runner.py data/test.skp
   ```

## Sparkup Language Features

### Data Types
- **Booleans**: Supports `true` and `false`, along with logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- **Numbers**: Includes integers and floating-point numbers with standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- **Strings**: Allows assignment of string literals to variables.

### Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Basic arithmetic operations include `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- **Relational Operators**: Supports `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=` for comparisons.
- **Ternary Operator**: Implements a ternary conditional operator: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`.

### Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements**: Provides a `chk-alt` construct for branching logic.   
- **Loops**: Implements `while` loops and a simplified `for` loop syntax.

### Output Functionality
- The `print` function outputs values of booleans, numbers, and strings directly to the console.

## Sparkup Components

### 1. Tokenizer
The tokenizer breaks down source code into identifiable symbols, referred to as tokens. This step is crucial in recognizing keywords, literals, and operators in the Sparkup language.

- **Token Types**: Recognizes tokens for numbers, identifiers, strings, arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), assignment (`=`), relational operators, and special characters.
- **Reserved Keywords**: Supports built-in keywords such as `print`, `chk`, `alt`, `while`, `for`, `true`, and `false`.

### 2. Parser
The parser processes tokens generated by the tokenizer, constructing a parse tree representing the hierarchical structure of the code, following predefined grammar rules.

- **Grammar Rules**: Defines syntax rules for various statements, expressions, and control structures in the language.

### 3. Runner :

- **Core Functionality**: The Runner interprets and executes Sparkup programs by managing variable states, evaluating expressions, and processing statements like assignments, conditionals, loops (while, for), and print commands.
- **Excecution Flow**: It parses the input .skp file, builds a program structure, and executes it sequentially, ensuring dynamic evaluation of expressions and proper program flow.


## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the compiler.
- **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**: Provides tokenizing and parsing functionality.
