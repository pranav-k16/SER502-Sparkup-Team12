#SER502-Sparkup-Team12
Overview
Sparkup is a simple, custom-designed programming language that supports basic data types (Booleans, numbers, strings), conditional logic, looping structures, and variable assignments. The goal of Sparkup is to provide an easy-to-use language that demonstrates core concepts of programming language design and execution, including lexical analysis, parsing, and runtime evaluation.

Sparkup offers support for common programming constructs, including Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT), arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), conditional statements (ternary operator and traditional if-else), loops (for and while loops), and print statements for all supported data types.

Sparkup is designed with educational purposes in mind, making it an ideal tool for learning programming language design and implementation.
