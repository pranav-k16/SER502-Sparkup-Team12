# Contribution Report for Sparkup Project - Milestone 02
# Team Members: Pranav Kumar Jalagam, Naga Durga Amarnadh Reddy Dodda, Mokshith Sai Gadela, Harish Bandlamudi

## Pranav Kumar Jalagam - Lexer and Tokenization
- Responsibilities:
  - Developed the core lexer functionality, defining token types, reserved keywords, and regular expressions for Sparkup literals.
- Contributions:
  - Created rules for integer, float, string, and boolean literals and implemented error handling for unrecognized tokens.
  - Conducted initial tests to verify tokenization accuracy with sample Sparkup code.

## Naga Durga Amarnadh Reddy Dodda - Grammar and Parsing
- Responsibilities:
  - Defined core grammar rules for variable declarations, assignments, print statements, and conditionals.
- Contributions:
  - Designed and tested grammar rules for arithmetic and logical expressions with attention to operator precedence.
  - Implemented initial structure for parsing conditionals and computation blocks.

## Mokshith Sai Gadela - Parse Tree and Conditional Logic
- Responsibilities:
  - Established Parse Tree for expressions and control flow, integrating with parser output.
- Contributions:
  - Created parse tree nodes for logical and arithmetic expressions, ensuring consistency with Sparkup grammar.
  - Developed and validated conditional parsing (`chk` and `alt`).

## Harish Bandlamudi - Loops and Testing
- Responsibilities:
  - Implemented loop constructs (for and while) within the parser.
- Contributions:
  - Created and tested loop structures, handling edge cases and integrating with the parse tree.
  - Documented test cases and debugged loop scenarios to validate parser behavior.

# Final Milestone Focus Areas
- Pranav Kumar Jalagam: Extend lexer capabilities and add detailed debugging support.
- Naga Durga Amarnadh Reddy Dodda: Optimize grammar and parsing for complex structures.
- Mokshith Sai Gadela: Generated Parse Tree and enhanced conditional logic handling.
- Harish Bandlamudi: Finalize loop integration and conduct thorough testing.
