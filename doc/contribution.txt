# Contribution Report for Sparkup Project - Milestone 04
# Team Members: Pranav Kumar Jalagam, Naga Durga Amarnadh Reddy Dodda, Mokshith Sai Gadela, Harish Bandlamudi

## Pranav Kumar Jalagam - Lexer, Tokenization, and Runtime Environment
- Responsibilities:
  - Extended the lexer functionality to cover additional operators and debugging support.
  - Worked on integrating the runtime environment to execute the parse tree.
- Contributions:
  - Added support for additional operators (ternary and logical) to the lexer.
  - Implemented error handling improvements for invalid characters and unclosed strings.
  - Integrated runtime functionality to interpret and execute the parse tree.

## Naga Durga Amarnadh Reddy Dodda - Grammar, Parsing, and Parse Tree Generation
- Responsibilities:
  - Enhanced grammar rules to support complete language constructs including loops and nested conditionals.
  - Worked on refining parse tree generation for complex expressions.
- Contributions:
  - Optimized grammar to handle nested structures (loops and conditionals) with improved error handling.
  - Refined parse tree representation for clarity and ease of traversal in the runtime environment.
  - Conducted tests on parsing edge cases to ensure grammar stability and robustness.

## Mokshith Sai Gadela - Parse Tree, Conditional Logic, and Intermediate Representation
- Responsibilities:
  - Finalized parse tree structure and implemented intermediate code generation.
  - Enhanced conditional logic parsing for seamless integration with the runtime environment.
- Contributions:
  - Developed intermediate representations for conditional constructs (`chk` and `alt`) and loops.
  - Ensured accurate parse tree traversal and transformation to intermediate code.
  - Conducted debugging and validations to guarantee correct execution of sample programs.

## Harish Bandlamudi - Loop Constructs, Testing, and Runtime Execution
- Responsibilities:
  - Finalized and tested loop constructs, ensuring proper runtime execution.
  - Validated the integration of the runtime environment with the parser.
- Contributions:
  - Implemented loop execution mechanisms (for and while) in the runtime environment.
  - Developed comprehensive test cases for all language features, focusing on edge cases.
  - Conducted final debugging sessions to ensure parser and runtime consistency.
